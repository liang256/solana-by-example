# Set Counter

This is an improved version of Counter example. Besides the increament instruction, we will add 2 more instructions: decreament, and set value!

In this example, we will learn how to branch instructions after entering the endpoint of a program. 
Still, we will implement this in vanilla Rust.

This example was originally from Josh's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXutkadkqkE&t=3s) from his [channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JoshsDevBox). Please check out this amazing channel right now!
