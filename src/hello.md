# Hello Solana

This section cover:
- Get the idea of client and program.
- How to deploy a Solana program
- Use a client to interact with the program

### Client & Program

"Program" is "Smart Contract" in Solana. It just terminology difference.

If you are a web3 newbie, you may take program (smart contract) as AWS Lambda.

Just like client-server model that we are familiar in web2, 
we develop and deploy prgrams then use clients to interact
with them. it can be a typescript client, Python client, or CLI client.

For this example, we make a simple program that only log message: "Hello Solana" with using a framwork.
And we will demo how to use typescript and Rust client to interact with the program.
