# Counter

In this example, we will implement a counter on Solana. 
When a user invokes the program the counter will add 1.

Concepts that we will learn about:
- Program Derive Address (PDA)
- Serialize & deserialize data

This example is actually an offical example program, [example-helloworld](https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld), from [Solana-labs](https://github.com/solana-labs). I rename it since I think its core function is a counter, which is a good example to demostrate how state data stored on Solana.
